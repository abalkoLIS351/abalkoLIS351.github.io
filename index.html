		<h2>Early Life</h2>
	
		<p>I,Andrew Ryan Balko, was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on August 16th, 1999. I grew up in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, where I spent the first eighteen years of my life before moving to Madison, Wisconsin. I have a younger brother, Nicholas, who is two years behind me who attends the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. In middle school and high school, I played basketball and bowling, making the varsity teams for each in 2017 and 2018 respectively.</p>
	
		<h2>Volunteering and Work</h2>
	
		<p>I have had a few volunteering experiences through my middle school, church, and high school. At my middle school, Zion Lutheran, I was able to get involved by regularly helping on designated "take down" days after the Christmas and graduation services to put away the giant tarps and chairs set up in the gymnasium, alongside volunteering with the janitor to help take on responsibilities when he could not make it to work due to family complications. I also volunteered at my church to usher services throughout middle school and early high school. Finally, I volunteered through my high school basketball and bowling teams. Both teams partnered with youth programs that I often played an active role in. For the bowling program, I helped by coming to practices to show different practices and drills that each kid could do to help them individually alongside motivating them to do some of the drills that don't seem as applicable on the surface as it really is. I was more active in the basketball youth program, where I would help coach on Wednesdays and in the summer, referee for exhibition games between different age levels, and help host a tournament for them each year. I also has work experience through the University of Wisconsin Athletics where I work with guest services, and the Milwaukee Brewers where I am a gate screener. During the pandemic, I picked up two seasonal jobs, one working for Maple Bluff Country Club in their bag room, and as a dish washer at Wisconsin Lutheran Chapel.</p>
	
		<h2>Intrests</h2>
	
		<p>My main interests lie within the realm of athletics, being a major baseball and basketball fan. I am an avid follower of the Milwaukee Brewers and all of college basketball. My love for college basketball has grown from a hobby to something I can actually profit off of by both helping people fill out brackets or selling his notes of every team to those of my friends, families, and acquaintances who want them. During the 2018-2019 season I predicted 80% of the power 6 conference games correctly, including the NCAA tournament, where I had three of the four final four teams correct. This past year has been a down swing at only 72.1%. I draw from this as inspiration for a lot of the media I makes, including an Instagram page I used to co-own, and a <a href="https://www.etg.today/"><strong>sports website</strong></a> that he used to write articles for before moving over fully to college football and NFL.</p><!--Website colors based off of new Brewer colors-->
